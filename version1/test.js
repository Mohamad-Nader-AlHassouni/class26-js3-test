// VERSION 1

/*
1.
Write a function that:
- Logs to the console numbers 1 to 100.
- However, if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5 it should log "Jackpot!" instead of the number.
- If it doesn't pass the function should log "multiple of 3" if it's a multiple of only 3
- If it's a multiple of 5 it should log "This is a multiple of 5"

Hint: use the modulo operator (%) to figure out if it's a multiple of 3/5. Make sure the remainder is 0, in order to pass the condition.
Hint: the order of conditional statements is important!
